# Security and Authentication with Node.js

It is my pleasure to share with you this project where I explore the best practices for security and authentication using Node.js. Please excuse the bland UI. 

## Technologies Used
- Express.js
- OpenSSL
- Helmet
- Passport
- OAuth2
- Cookies

I had a lot of fun revisiting these concepts and digging deep to truly understand them. We should never take security lightly.

## Usage

To run this project, please ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, clone the repository and run:
npm install
npm start

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Note

Please note that this project is for educational purposes only and should not be used in a production environment without proper security measures in place.
